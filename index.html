                <h1>Nathaniel White</h1>
                <p>Ever since I was introduced to classical composition, I've wanted to be a college level band director. It is my belief that music is the gateway to emotion. I could rant for hours about the importance that music has played in human history, but I won't.</p>
                <p>Instead, I'll just say this, imagine your life without music. Imagine sitting in a resturaunt on a first date, and not having music their to break an awkward silence. Imagine riding in an elevator, and instead of getting an annoying song stuck in your head, you hear every creak of the machine as it takes you three stories up. Imagine having a wedding, with no reception. Imagine the silence that would be created by the lack of music.</p>
                <p>Music as evolved similar to how humans have evolved. With each new interaction of culture, comes a new style of music. I guess what I'm trying to say here, is that, listening to music is the equiavlent of listening to the composer's state of mind.</p>
                <p>Not to mention the increase in intelligence that comes with learning an instrument. It treats the mind like puddy and stretches it so that you can do things you never thought possible. Of course, that's a metaphor, but in all seriousness, you never know what you're truly capable of.</p>
