                <h1>Nathaniel White</h1>
                <p>Ever since I was introduced to classical composition, I've wanted to be a college level band director. It is my belief that music is the gateway to emotion. I could rant for hours about the importance that music has played in human history, but I won't.</p>
                <p>Instead, I'll just say this. I honestly don't think that I'd be here today without it. Classical music has changed my life in countless ways. No matter what age you are, I believe everyone should learn an instrument. It treats the mind like puddy and stretches it so that you can do things you never thought possible.</p>
                <p>Of course, those are metaphors, but in all seriousness, you never know what you're truly capable of.</p>
