                <h2>A Contemplation of Saying Goodbye</h2>
                <p>
                    This piece is very progammatic. Using two different motifs, I've displayed a storyline. This is that story.

                    A young person has a pretty good life, however, they are very lonely. One day, someone catches this person's eye. The person contemplates whether or not they should even go after this person (in a relationship type way) or not. Eventually, they decide to do it. Then, the person is welcomed with pure bliss. The happy couple even get married. Unfortunately, though, this happiness doesn't last for long. They get a divorce and are both incredibly distraught. The person that had a good life, now regrets every decision they've made. Fortunately, they eventually decide that they aren't going to let the absence of the other person ruin the rest of their life.
